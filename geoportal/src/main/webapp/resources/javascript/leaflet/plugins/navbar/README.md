Leaflet.NavBar
==============

NOTE: this code has been modified for use in the OpenGeoportal project.
Modifications include the addition of a Zoom Box control and storing the
bounds in the history (instead of zoom and map center), since the main
application relies on bounds-based queries. In its current state,
this plugin will not work as-is outside of OGP, as it relies on a sprite
sheet that lives in the main project. Future work could see the
inclusion of the relevant sprites or replacement of sprites with font
icons, etc.

## Install via Bower
````js
bower install leaflet-navbar
````

<a name="using" />
## Using the plugin

The default state for the control is just below the zoom control. This will allow map users to navigate forward and back in the map's view history as well as navigate to a home view.

````js
var navbar = L.control.navbar().addTo(map);
````

methods:
````js
navbar.goHome();
````
Go to home. Same as clicking on the home button.

````js
navbar.goBack();
navbar.goForward();
````
Navigate through history. Will return false if no view is available
to navigate to.

````js
navbar.zoomBoxOn();
navbar.panHandOn();
````
Toggle between Zoom Box and Pan (default) controls.
