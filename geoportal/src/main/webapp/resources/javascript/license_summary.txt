A note about OSM attribution:

	How to credit OpenStreetMap

	We require that you use the credit “© OpenStreetMap contributors”.

	You must also make it clear that the data is available under the Open Database License, and if using our map tiles, 
	that the cartography is licensed as CC BY-SA. You may do this by linking to this copyright page. Alternatively, and as 
	a requirement if you are distributing OSM in a data form, you can name and link directly to the license(s). In media 
	where links are not possible (e.g. printed works), we suggest you direct your readers to openstreetmap.org (perhaps by 
	expanding 'OpenStreetMap' to this full address), to opendatacommons.org, and if relevant, to creativecommons.org.

	For a browsable electronic map, the credit should appear in the corner of the map.

A note about Google Maps attributions:

ref:
http://www.google.com/permissions/geoguidelines/attr-guide.html

	Do I need to use the text provided on the imagery?

	The automatically generated Google logo and data provider attribution may only be removed or obstructed if reintroduced 
	in a visible form elsewhere within the Content (e.g. photo caption below a Google Earth still). In other words, your text 
	must be as visible as it would have been if you had used the default text that we provide.

	What does the attribution text need to say?

	If you are not using the text provided directly on Google Maps and Google Earth imagery, the text of your attribution must 
	say the name “Google” and the relevant data provider(s), such as “Map data: Google, Bluesky”. You may customize the style 
	and placement of the attribution text, just so long as the text is legible to the average viewer or reader. Note that Google 
	logos cannot be used in-line (e.g. "These maps from [Google logo].”)"
